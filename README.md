# Miscellaneous Scripts

These are some scripts I've written over time to do some random tasks.

## GreaseMonkey Scripts

These are the original source to some GreaseMonkey scripts I've written, including:

* YTGrab: a script that adds download links on YouTube video pages
* DMGrab: the same, but for Dailymotion

Use [this](http://compressorrater.thruhere.net/) to minify them (if you wish).

Enjoy.
